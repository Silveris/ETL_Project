Michael Cherkassky ETL
----Part-----
I set up the SQLite Database to mirror the CSV's that were created.
I also performed some web scraping to gather descriptive text on each city in our database.

---Problems----
No big issues on this end aside from setting up the database correctly to mirror exact format of the CSV's.
Git push/pull/etc.
Re-importing over tables that were already created caused some problems, but nothing we couldn't work through.
Funky data coming from web scraping made us think critically on how to set up our schema (Dave's High reading coming in as '--' rather than an actual number).
