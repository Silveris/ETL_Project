Dave ETL report
--- Part ---
I managed the git repo and was responsible for 
the webscraping of weather.com. for the most part I was able to
get everything done as intended. 

-- problems -- 
the webscraping itself was strange in that what I pulled from
the site was inconsistent each time I ran the file. I’m thinking that
it is caused by whatever they’re using to generate their webpage but the 
html I pulled didn’t stay consistent.
- Fix - 
managed to get it to work by rerunning the script on a loop until
all the cities I wanted data for where filled in.
