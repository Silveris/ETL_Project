We will be pulling the data from:
    API - Open Weather Api
    Scraping - Weather.com
    
    
for:
    High
    Low
    Humidity
    Pressure

for a list of cities.
--------------------------------------------

we will clean up the data gathered and put them into
pandas Dataframes to be loaded into a sqlite db

---------------------------------------------

The data will be uploaded into a database with the tabels:
    Scraped
    Api
    
That each contain cols called:
    City
    High
    Low
    Humidity
    Pressure
    
The end goal is to compare these 2 sources of weather data and look for diffrences
there shouldnt be any as both scripts should be run at the same time and contain the same 
values.
