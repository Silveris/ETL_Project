Mica Malleus -- ETL

Our plan was to gather weather data for 10 cities in the USA. My part of the project job was to use https://openweathermap.org/api to
extract the high, low, and current temperatures as well the humidity, and barometric pressure, and finally the date so that there would be
a record of when the data was collected. 

I wrote a script to gather the stats we wanted and saved that to a Pandas dataframe where The data was transformed by updating the columns
names and  also used datetime to convert UNIX time to a regular date time. The dataframe was exported to a csv file. Finally, the Pandas
script was saved out to a Python file and wrapped in a function so that Dave could run both the API script and his Web scraping script
simultaneously.


Dave ETL report
--- Part ---
I managed the git repo and was responsible for 
the webscraping of weather.com. for the most part I was able to
get everything done as intended. 

-- problems -- 
the webscraping itself was strange in that what I pulled from
the site was inconsistent each time I ran the file. I’m thinking that
it is caused by whatever they’re using to generate their webpage but the 
html I pulled didn’t stay consistent.
- Fix - 
managed to get it to work by rerunning the script on a loop until
all the cities I wanted data for where filled in.
